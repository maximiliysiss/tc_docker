# 🐳 TotalCommander Docker/Kubernetes Plugin

**TotalCommander Docker/Kubernetes Plugin** — a plugin for Total Commander that lets you browse and interact with Docker containers as if they were part of the filesystem.

- ⌨️ Execute commands via Total Commander’s command line

- 📁 Directory operations:
    - Create
